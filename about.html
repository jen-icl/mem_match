                <h2>Do you recall learning about the fascinating topic of <br> our solar system when you were young?</h2>
                <h3>And this excitement about the Space was further nurtured in 2018 when a <br> private spacecraft company, SpaceX, successfully launched a reusable launch system Falcon Heavy.</h3>

                <h4>Discovered in 1930, Pluto was found as the ninth planet of our solar system.</h4>
                <p>
                    This fact was true for over 75 years, until Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet".<br>
                    Because Pluto lacked in one criteria, it wasn't cleared from other orbiting bodies.<br>
                    Pluto orbits among a ring of icy bodies coined as the "Kuiper Belt".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is themed in memory of the time when Pluto was considered as a sibling to our planet Earth.<br>
                    This is a memory match game. The rules are as follows: 18 cards are faced down, and the player flips two cards over per turn.<br>
                    The card remains face up if the two card matches, otherwise the card is turned back.<br>
                    The objective is to find all the matched pairs of cards.
