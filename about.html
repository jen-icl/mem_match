                    For over 75 years, Pluto was thought of as one of the eight siblings of Earth that orbits around the sun. <br>

                For more than 75 years after its 1930 discovery, Pluto was regarded as our solar system's
                ninth planet — a distant and frigid oddball, to be sure, but a member of Earth's immediate
                family nonetheless. Then, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto
                as a "dwarf planet," a newly created category that the organization explicitly stressed made
                Pluto distinct from the eight "true" planets.

                A true planet, according to the IAU's newly devised definition, must meet three criteria:
                It must circle the sun and no other object (so, moons are out); it must be big enough to be
                rounded into a sphere or spheroid by its own gravity, but not so large that its innards host
                the fusion reactions that power stars; and it must have "cleared its neighborhood" of other
                orbiting bodies.
                Pluto failed at this last hurdle, because its neighborhood — the ring of icy bodies beyond
                Neptune known as the Kuiper Belt — is far from cleared. -->
                <!--We have always been fascinated about the universe and what space was about
                    The inspiration for space theme came about one night when I looked up to the sky with a full moon but no stars.-->
